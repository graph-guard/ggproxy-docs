<span class="line"></span></code></pre></div><p>If we assume that every user has ~100 friends on average, then the above query could result in <code>100*100*100*100=100&#39;000&#39;000</code> database queries and a response JSON size of approximately 1.6 GB. The computational complexity of requests of this kind can grow exponentially and easily overwhelm even the most powerful of servers. GraphQL APIs exposed to the internet must therefore be protected from maliciously-complex queries!</p><p>There are several protection techniques:</p><ul><li>Query Complexity Analysis.</li><li>Execution Time Limitation.</li><li>Execution Resource Limitation.</li><li>Query Whitelisting.</li></ul><p>Different approaches all have their pros and cons. However, before ggproxy query whitelisting wasn&#39;t feasible because comparing incoming queries byte-by-byte isn&#39;t practical due to the fact that they enforce a particular query structure while GraphQL queries can be composed differently and also require all combinations of inputs to be hard-coded.</p><p>Using its flexible templating language and fast matching algorithms, ggproxy revolutionizes query whitelisting and allows for more GraphQL adoption across different industries and project!</p><h2 id="why-not-just-use-rpc-rest-etc-instead" tabindex="-1">Why not just use RPC/REST/etc. instead? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-not-just-use-rpc-rest-etc-instead" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>One of GraphQL&#39;s key strengths is that it allows your frontend and backend to iterate mostly independently of each other due to loose coupling. RPC-like approaches to API design (e.g., REST) can lead to tight coupling, which has both up- and downsides. The biggest downside of tight coupling between your clients and your API is that you have to introduce changes to the code of the backend API every time frontend requirements change. With ggproxy you get the resilience of tight coupled RPC and the flexibility of loosely coupled GraphQL because no code needs to be changed on the backend, only the whitelist needs to be updated to cover new data requirements of the client.</p><p>Imagine the following REST API in late stages of development:</p><div class="language-"><button class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">GET /users/:id -&gt; ?{</span></span>
